# ISRD-International-Self-Reported-Delinquency-Study

Summary/Result 

  1. Discovered a strong correlation between the traumatic instances and crimes committed (Bar Graphs) The greater the traumatic cases (Parenting and Victim) in a particular nation, the more likely is a delinquent act committed. 
  2. The thematic map provided an efficient way to plot the geographic distribution of the Delinquency per closeness ratio (Choropleth Graph). Found an inverse relationship between closeness and delinquency. Hence, the greater the closeness in the family, the lesser the number of delinquent acts committed. 
  3. The color coding system in a 2D grid represents how likely a person victim of a particular scenario is to commit a crime efficaciously. (Heatmap) The map clearly depicts a victimized person committing more violent crimes than nonviolent crimes. 
  4.  The concentric circles provide a coherent way to clearly distinguish a male or a female in a particular grade ( 7th - 9th) committing a crime. (Nested Pie Chart) 5. Reduction in dimensions and retaining the necessary information effectively helped denote patterns and relationships within the data to become more clearer.

Motivation 

  Understanding the complex interactions between trauma, family factors, demographics, and delinquency is crucial to effectively addressing the issue of juvenile delinquency. Visualizing these relationships through various   graphs and charts can provide critical insights and inform interventions and policies aimed at supporting at-risk youth. By using visual representations such as scatterplots, bar graphs, and pie charts, we can gain a       deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to delinquent behavior and identify potential risk and protective factors. In conclusion, visualizing the relationships between trauma, family factors, demographics,       and delinquency can provide critical insights into the complex interactions underlying juvenile delinquent behavior. By using various graphs and charts, we can identify potential risk and protective factors, guide           targeted interventions, and inform policies aimed at supporting at-risk youth. This approach can lead to more effective and comprehensive strategies for addressing juvenile delinquency and supporting the well-being of       youth in our communities.
